      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>
        Hi, I'm Caleb, an Electrical Engineer by education and Software Developer by passion/trade. In my free time, I like to contribute to open source and study programming languages. This often leads to me developing toy apps that never see the light of day (I'm trying to get better at sharing). I don't host anything on this page, but feel free to check out the side bar (left) for links!
      </p>
      <p>
        If you have an neat project you think I might be interested in, feel free to send me an email (address is in the sidebar). Depending on the nature of the project I might start contributing ASAP, otherwise a contract can be worked out.
